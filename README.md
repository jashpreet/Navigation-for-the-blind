# Navigation for the blind
An algorithm that detects and outlines sidewalks or driving lanes using python. These outlines can be used to help the blind navigate. \
P.S - This algorithm was originally made to detect sidewalks. It just happened to work on driving lanes too.
## Getting started
Both the python files have to be ran simultaneously. The detection.py file will append it's results into a text file. The output.py file will read the results and say it out loud for the blind.
### Prerequisites
* Opencv (image processing module)
* Numpy (support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices)
* Math
* Time
* Scipy 
* pyttsx3
### Installation
All the wheel files for python 3 can be downloaded from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
To install, run

    pip install WheelFileName.whl

Alternative - 

    pip install opencv-python
    pip install numpy
    pip install pyttsx3
